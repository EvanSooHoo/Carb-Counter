A very simple Swift application for personal use.  I have saved carb counts for my favorite foods; this app allows me to input things I have eaten today (with servings) and keeps a running count of how many carbs I have eaten.  If something is not on the list, I can input "custom" and directly input the number of grams.  There is also a "reset" button

Though simple, making this was a learning experience and a way for me to get exposed to the Swift language
